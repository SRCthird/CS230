Design documentation for 'Draw It or Lose It,' a web-based game application inspired by the 1980s show 'Win Lose or Draw.' The project outlines a Java-based solution for game session management, player interaction, and database management to ensure a scalable and maintainable gaming experience.

## Client Overview
**Q:** Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?</br>
**A:** The client, "Draw It or Lose It," required a web-based game application inspired by the 1980s game show "Win, Lose or Draw." The software needed to include a game server, a client interface, and a database management system.

## Strengths in Documentation
**Q:** What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?</br>
**A:** I excelled in outlining the system architecture and design constraints, providing a clear framework for development.

## Design Document Benefits
**Q:** What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?</br>
**A:** The design document was instrumental in structuring the approach and understanding the client's requirements and which system architecture would be most benificial to them.

## Area for Revision
**Q:** If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</br>
**A:** I would revise the evaluation section to provide a more in-depth analysis and comparison of different operating platforms.

## User Needs Interpretation
**Q:** How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?</br>
**A:** I focused on ensuring real-time interaction and cross-platform compatibility, which are crucial for the game's success. Considering user needs is vital to meet their expectations and provide a satisfying experience.

## Software Design Approach
**Q:** How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?</br>
**A:** I used a methodical approach, understanding the client's requirements, and structuring the system architecture accordingly. In the future, I would use UML diagrams for modeling and planning and research the latest technologies and best practices for similar applications.
